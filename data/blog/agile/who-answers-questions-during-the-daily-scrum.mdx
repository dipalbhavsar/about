summary: Encouraging everyone to answer the questions of the daily scrum creates a greater feeling of team coherence; the team is bonded and moving together as one in the same direction.

I grew up in one of those families in which Mom made us eat at least a little of everything she cooked for dinner.

As you can imagine, some evenings, she'd cook something that my young self just did not want to eat--or sometimes even taste.

And then it would become a battle of wills between my mom and me. My younger sister, of course, was to the same rule.

My mom clearly knew, but she was OK with it.

This may be OK for a family. But on a Scrum team, the same rules should apply to all team members, at least when participating in a daily scrum, which is what I'd like to address here.

This means that ScrumMasters and product owners should give updates in daily standups. To allow otherwise is to say the ScrumMaster and product owner are above the team, kind of how my dad was part of the family but clearly not subject to all the same rules as eight- and six-year-old kids.

Encouraging everyone to answer the questions of the daily scrum creates a greater feeling of team coherence; the team is bonded and moving together as one in the same direction.

And creating that feeling will help our teams succeed with agile.
