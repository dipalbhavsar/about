Last week, I told you about the worst possible time to estimate your product backlog items. (Reminder: it’s during sprint planning.)

And I promised that this week, I’d share with you my thoughts on when is the best time for estimating your product backlog items.

I got a lot of emails last week saying that the best time to estimate product backlog items is during a team’s product backlog refinement meeting. That actually is a great time to do it.

But it’s not my preference.

I like estimating product backlog items immediately following a daily scrum, usually two or three days before the end of the sprint. There are a few advantages to this:
-	It’s late enough in the sprint that there hopefully will not be many new product backlog items thought of that sprint
-	It’s not so late, though, that the product owner does not have time to act on the new information provided by the estimates
-	The whole team is present, and everyone is already interrupted and available
I prefer estimating product backlog items (usually with Planning Poker) immediately after a daily scrum rather than during a product backlog refinement meeting because I don’t generally recommend the entire team participate in refinement meetings.

On most teams, requiring the participation of the entire team in backlog refinement meetings is unnecessary. Those meetings can be thought of as pre-planning checkpoints. They help ensure that a product owner has a sufficient understanding of the items at the top of the product backlog.

This comes about from meeting participants asking the product owner questions and making sure no dark corners remain in highest priority items. Sure, the more team members who participate in that, the more complete the questions will be.

However, my experience is that a sweet spot can be found with about half of the team participating in any given refinement meeting. This achieves a good balance in keeping total meeting time down while still making sure most issues are raised during grooming.

If you, however, prefer to have the entire team participate in refinement meetings and choose to estimate product backlog items then, by all means, continue to do so.

Either approach will help your team succeed with agile,
