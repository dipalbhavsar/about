summary: Rounding up estimates can help account for unforeseen challenges, uncertainties, or potential complexities. This approach encourages teams to allocate sufficient time or resources, reduces the risk of underestimating tasks, and improves the accuracy of project planning and delivery timelines.

Last week, I suggested you think of the numbers you use when estimating as ranges. If you are using 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 20, for example, the 13 is used to hold all estimates from 9 to 13. And I said the numbers can be best thought of as buckets of water.
 
You might have read that and been concerned that this rounding up of estimates could lead to inflated or padded schedules. Let me explain why that usually won’t happen.
 
Consider a product backlog item that you believe should be 10 points. But you’re using the modified Fibonacci sequence I listed above and are following the rounding up strategy I recommend. And so, the estimate you put on that product backlog item will be 13.
 
Next, let’s assume that at 13 points, the item is too big to bring into a sprint. And so the team splits it into smaller stories. Perhaps they split it into three smaller stories, which they estimate as 5, 5 and 2 points.
 
Notice what happened there with the numbers.
 
The three small stories add up to 12 points. That’s one less than the 13-point estimate you actually put on the larger story. But it’s two more than the 10 you really thought was the right estimate for the initial large story.
 
By forcing the estimate into the next larger bucket, you’ve improved the likelihood of correctly predicting the delivery date of this project.
 
If you had rounded down to the next lower estimate (8), the project would be four points late. If you had used your actual estimate (10), the project would be two points late.
 
Instead, by using the estimate values as buckets and rounding up, you’ve made it more likely you’ll deliver this project on time.
 
But couldn’t the 10-point story have turned out to really be 8 points? Sure. But it could also have been 14 or 15 or any other number.
 
Work tends to expand when looked at in detail. In first looking at the story in this example, the team thought it would be 10 points. But when they looked at it later, they decided it was really 12 points. That’s common.
 
If you’ve been agile for a while and have not been estimating with buckets like this, you’ve probably experienced situations like I’m describing.
 
For example, your team makes great progress one sprint and your burndown chart should reflect that. But some product backlog items were split during the sprint and their estimates went up. And so your burndown chart doesn’t look so good after all for that sprint.
 
Rounding up as I’m describing isn’t padding. It’s a reflection of the uncertainty in estimates. Using an estimating approach that reflects this uncertainty will help you succeed with agile.
