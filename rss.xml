&lt;p&gt;In previous section, I explained about SharePoint Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to take a look at different patterns available for SharePoint development and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s get started and look at the different development, customization and extensibility options we have in SharePoint today. Since Microsoft has introduced this new SharePoint Framework model, they have not deprecated or removed any of the previous options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 25px;&quot;&gt;Development and Deployment in the SharePoint Framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explore the SharePoint Framework a bit more, then compare it to each of the other options and how they differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first start by looking at the SharePoint Framework. SharePoint Framework customizations execute within the client. They are script-based, not compiled and thus they run in the context of the current page. This is also the only way to customize SharePoint’s modern pages in a supported way.
Because SharePoint Framework based customizations run in the context of the current page and not in some IFRAME, they are responsive and accessible and by nature, mobile friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customizations deployed for use with the SharePoint Framework are uploaded to the tenant’s app catalog site making the customizations available across any site within the tenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the initial release, the only thing developers could build with the SharePoint Framework are client-side web parts. However, later, Microsoft introduced extensions. These provided parity with some existing customization options we had in previous models. They include things like application customizers (aka script link &amp;#x26; delegate controls), field customizers (aka client-side rendering or CSR and JSLink) and command sets (aka custom actions). Recentrly, Microsoft also has announce one more capability as Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at each of the other types of SharePoint development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 25px;&quot;&gt;Development &amp; Deployment with traditional Farm Solutions&lt;/p&gt;
 
Now let’s compare the SharePoint Framework to the farm or full-trust solutions.
&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;width:95%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;SharePoint Framework&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Farm Solutions&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Server-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Render and execute in page context&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fully server side execution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Only way to costomize modern pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Only supported on-premises environment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Open source cross-platform tooling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Built in Visual Studio on Windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Support first &amp; third party development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to tenant or site &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to farm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited to creating client-side web parts, UI extentions and Libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Build web parts, timer jobs, event receiver, features receivers, etc.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farm solutions are typically comprised of compiled code that runs on the .NET Framework. They also consist of some amount of declarative markup, specifically XML, that tells SharePoint under what conditions the code should run. They are deployed using solution packages, *.WSP files, and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farm solutions, because they run on the server in the context of the SharePoint farm process, have full access to the SharePoint server-side API. Therefore developers can use these types of solutions to do anything supported by the API with custom code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because farm solutions are fully trusted customizations or highly trusted solutions, they are not permitted in hosted SharePoint environments such as SharePoint Online in Office 365. As such, they are limited to on-premises deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, due to the server-side and full-trust nature of these types of customizations, farm solutions are almost exclusively built using Visual Studio by developers who are on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farm solutions are scoped to the entire farm, well they can be scoped all the way up to the entire SharePoint farm, but depending on the customizations in the farm solution, they can be scoped at the web application, site collection or as granular as an individual site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farm solutions are the core of all types of customizations going way back to the beginning in SharePoint. This means we use them to create server-side web parts, timer jobs, event receivers, feature receivers and other sorts of controls. These are all things the SharePoint Framework does not have the ability to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 25px;&quot;&gt;Development &amp; Deployment with Sandboxed Solutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;width:95%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;SharePoint Framework&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Sendbox Solutions&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Server-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Render and execute in page context&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Only way to costomize modern pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Declarative only solutions available in SharePoint OnLine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Open source cross-platform tooling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Built in Visual Studio on Windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Support first &amp; third party development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Responsive, accessible &amp; mobile friendly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to tenant or site &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to site collection&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited to creating client-side web parts, UI extentions and Libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Build features &amp; declarative solutions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 
After farm solutions came sandboxed solutions, introduced by Microsoft to let developers create server-side compiled solutions run in a hosted environment.
&lt;p&gt;Initially sandboxed solutions, like farm solutions which they were derived from, consisted of both declarative and compiled code. The idea was to give customers a way to customize &amp;#x26; extend their site collections without the full trust risks from farm solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this changed over time to the tune that Microsoft removed support for compiled-code sandboxed solutions in SharePoint Online in Office 365. You can still do declarative sandboxed solutions in Office 365, just no managed code. Also, like farm solutions, sandboxed solutions are created using the Office and SharePoint developer tools Microsoft offers as an extension to Visual Studio, the version of Visual Studio proper that runs on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, like farm solutions, sandboxed solutions are created using the Office and SharePoint developer tools Microsoft offers as an extension to Visual Studio, the version of Visual Studio proper that runs on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandboxed solutions are scoped to the site collection they are installed and activated within. Unlike farm solutions that can be activated at a farm or web application scope, the widest scope possible for a sandboxed solution is a site collection. This is true for declarative solutions today as well as when we could still do compiled code based solutions when they were supported in SharePoint Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to do a lot more with sandboxed solutions when compiled code was supported however, isn’t supported anymore.
Therefore, sandboxed solutions can be used today to provision declarative solutions such as site columns, content types, list templates and instances. We can also use them to provision files like ASPX pages with no code in them as well as JavaScript, CSS and image files to deploy custom client-side customizations to a SharePoint site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 25px;&quot;&gt;Development &amp; Deployment with Add-ins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;width:95%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;SharePoint Framework&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;SharePoint Add-Ins&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client or Server side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Render and execute in page context&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client side API&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Only way to costomize modern pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Open source cross-platform tooling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Execution context externalized from SharePoint using IFrame&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Support first &amp; third party development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Build with Visual Studio on Windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Responsive, accessible &amp; mobile friendly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to tenant or site &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to tenant and site&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited to creating client-side web parts, UI extentions and Libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Build web parts, remote event receivers, workflows and more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 
After solutions came SharePoint Add-ins, initially called apps. 
&lt;p&gt;These are available in two flavors, the SharePoint Hosted Add-in and the Provider Hosted Add-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;b&gt;SharePoint Hosted Add-ins&lt;/b&gt;, they run exclusively within a client-side context. Any custom business logic has to be implemented using JavaScript as the files deployed to SharePoint while stored in SharePoint, are not run on the server. They are rendered in the client and run there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;b&gt;Provider Hosted Add-ins&lt;/b&gt;, these are more open-ended. The developer, or provider, of the add-in, deploys a web application external to SharePoint and thus, can use any web development techniques at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the type of add-in you create, any time your add-in needs to communicate with SharePoint will do it using one of the client-side APIs Microsoft has included in SharePoint; either the CSOM or robust REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an add-in is manifested within a SharePoint site as a client part, it is done so using an IFRAME. This is due to the fact the add-in execution context is externalized from SharePoint, running either in the provider hosted web application or within the special SharePoint site that hosts the SharePoint Hosted add-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint add-ins were typically built by developers using Visual Studio on Windows. This is because Microsoft only created extensions for Visual Studio with designers for configuring an add-in and creating the add-in package file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Provider Hosted Add-ins could be authored using any technology for any hosting platform, we saw most developers using the Microsoft stack and host their provider hosted add-in web applications using IIS web servers on-premises or in Microsoft Azure websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you, as the developer, package up a SharePoint add-in, you take the resulting package file and upload it to the SharePoint tenant’s app catalog. Once this is done, the SharePoint add-in can then be installed within any SharePoint site in that tenant associated with that app catalog. Therefore, it is scoped to the tenant as far as where it can be used, but its functionality is scoped to the site to where it was installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can use SharePoint add-ins to create web parts, but not web parts the way we used to with solutions. Instead, these are created as web pages that are surfaced within SharePoint sites using IFRAMES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can also create event custom workflows, declarative workflows based on Workflow Manager and deploy those with add-ins. While the logic and implementation are hosted in a web application external from SharePoint, add-ins can also register remote event receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 25px;&quot;&gt;Development &amp; Deployment with JavaScript Injection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;width:95%;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; &gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;SharePoint Framework&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;JavaScript Injection&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client-side execution model&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Render and execute in page context&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Client side API&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Only way to costomize modern pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Open source cross-platform tooling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Build/implement with any build toolchain&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Support first &amp; third party development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Responsive, accessible &amp; mobile friendly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to tenant or site &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Scoped to SharePoint page&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited to creating client-side web parts, UI extentions and Libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Implemented manually, no automated deployment story&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 
The last type of customization is JavaScript injection which is used to customize existing SharePoint sites. Developers can use the content editor web part or more recently the script editor web part to get the customizations onto the page.
&lt;p&gt;Because of the very nature of JavaScript injection, these customizations will always execute within a client-side context. This means they leverage the user’s context and are rendered in the native page DOM.
By extension, because JavaScript injection involves client-side based development, these customizations have can leverage the client-side API, using either the CSOM or REST API, to leverage SharePoint data in the customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript injection does not involve specific developer tools. All developers need is a text editor and a way to upload the files to SharePoint. This is typically done using the browser, so developers are free to use any tool that they use to create their customizations when leveraging JavaScript injection.
These customizations are added to each SharePoint page on a page-by-page basis that means that these customizations are scoped to a specific page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because JavaScript injection customizations are done on a manual basis, typically there’s no packaging model, there’s no deployment model, and there’s no provisioning model that Microsoft provides.
Sure, SharePoint developers can build some sort of a customized solution but for the most part, these are usually customizations that are implemented on a case-by-case basis and they usually are implemented manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today,  we looked at the previous options for SharePoint customization and extensibility and we compared them to the SharePoint Framework. By now you should have an idea where the SharePoint Framework fits, and where it doesn’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next post, we will go through SharePoint Framework development toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conducting Effective Code Reviews]]></title><description><![CDATA[Code review is a process that enables peers and automated tools to check proposed changes to a codebase.

The main goal of a code review is to catch potential issues, security problems, and bugs before they are introduced to the codebase and prevent them from causing problems in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, the code review can be fun. You try to hunt down well-disguised bugs before they hurt your production. You feel like a superhero defending your town every time you find a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most software developers are expected to participate in code reviews, and yet few are offered any training or guidance on conducting and participating in an effective code review. Participants attempt to find the most appropriate solution to a problem given the constraints of time, effort, and skills of all involved. But how do we have that conversation? What does an effective conversation look like? And what are the challenges of participating in a code review, and how can you overcome them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following useful literature could help to understand the purpose of code review and help to set up the process for conducting the effective code review with team members:&lt;/p&gt;

Now a days, SharePoint Framework is much interesting since it has open wide range of offering with different technology stacks. This would be a big first step to learning the SharePoint Framework and I’m happy to help you on the road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have taken a look at the Microsoft’s documentation, it has provided you a step wise process to learn how to start with the development starting with setting up the development environment. Here, probably we are repeating the same steps with wide information behind a purpose of the each step that covers installation, development, execution and deployment of SharePoint’s client side web-parts. So let’s start with overview and then gradually move which supportive NPM packages that need to be installed for the development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 30px;&quot;&gt;What is SharePoint Framework?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft introduced the SharePoint Framework in May 2016. This is not only make client-side customization easier, but it includes APIs and dynamic ways of deploying.
Provides full support for client-side customization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, since beginning of SharePoint can satisfy basic collaboration and communication needs of organizations out of the box, soon after implementing a solution, many organizations may opt for going beyond the core functionality. For example, companies may want to modify dashboards and menus or integrate a SharePoint solution with other software or implement core branding, etc. All these changes can be implemented with customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint supports all kind of customization and integration with other systems. The new feature provides an ability to deploy a bundle that contains full fledged functionality that ease to develop and customize, same we could do for the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Execution is current context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed web-parts will always run in the current web context. In previous versions, most of all the web parts usually runs in context of IFRAME which was overhead to the process and execution time.This means not only will they load faster, but they will run within the context of the current user and using the current connection in the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Responsive &amp; accessible user interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed web parts are rendered in the current page DOM and not in an IFRAME, they will not have the same properties associated with them as IFRAMES have. One of the biggest benefits to this is that the customization will be responsive and accessible by nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Endless ability to access data from anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint provides data communication through it’s dedicated REST API within it’s lists and libraries. Apart from, it also flexible to fetch data from any product of Microsoft umbrella i.e. OneDrive, Exchange, Dynamic365, etc. through Microsoft Graph API. SharePoint also support to access data from other API’s too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Free to choose different development stack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous version of SharePoint, it has elected to go with a very different development model for the SharePoint Framework customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional SharePoint developers are used to using tools like Visual Studio to create SharePoint solutions or add-ins. With the SharePoint Framework, Microsoft has elected to embrace and adopt what is commonly referred to as the modern web development stack and tool-chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach opens the platform up to more developers because it is not limited to Windows; the tools are cross-platform. You can use any text editor you prefer. Popular open source tools are used to solve different parts of the build tool-chain from project scaffolding, building, serving, packaging all the way to deploying. This includes tools like Yeoman, Gulp, and Webpack, runtime like Node.js, package managers like NPM and editors like Visual Studio Code or Sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;Classic and modern experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating customization with the SharePoint Framework, you want to make sure you are not excluding your users from using them in legacy SharePoint sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the SharePoint Framework is that the customization you create will work not only in the new current modern pages, but they will also work in the traditional classic web part pages as well as publishing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next section we will learn how SharePoint framework development is different from traditional development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to prevent downstream problems?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently, I moved into my new home.

It was very exited moment moving from older home to new one for my family. My kids were also exited, rather focusing much more on transition, they focus much more on other exited things i.e. amenities, play area, swimming pool and much more – this is obvious, and we left them with their excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the possession, there is general process to check all accessories given by the builder i.e. test all lights/switched/plugs are working, sanitary-ware are in proper place and functioning, door locks with respective keys, etc. One of authorized person guide us very meticulously about all the resources they have fitted for us as per the commitment given during book the flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In during my observation of the new flat, I found some of the pipes under washbasin and kitchen sink were not straight. Instead the pipe from the drain goes down farther than necessary, curves right back up and then heads into the wall. The entire fitting looks like U-turn. This entire process was challenged my Physics knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting free from my transit and arranged require stuff, I Googled and found it is a P-Trap. That’s because it looks like a P turned on this side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do plumbers install P-traps? They must cost more to manufacture, so it increases their costs and time, which they may or may not be able to pass on to customers. They’re a little harder to install, so they cost the plumber time, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question curious me to get answered. So, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plumbers install P-traps because they prevent downstream problems. A P-trap under your sink will trap some crud and debris that makes it into the sink. Without a P-trap, debris would flow farther into your pipes and be much harder to fix when it creates a clog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And good plumbers care about this even though they know they may not be the plumber to return to fix the problem. How smart they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good plumbers care because they’re good plumbers. Installing a P-trap under your sink is simply the right thing to do because it prevents downstream problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a being software developer, should we behave the same way? Good team members care - not just about their own work but also about the work of everyone downstream of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a code is just a state of mind toward solving logical issue. Composing different patterns, best practices, considering different test cases and much more are value added during writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a code reviewer, I was recently helping a team incorporate more automated testing into their work. Some programmers, who viewed their job as nothing more than writing what they considered good code, balked at the idea of altering their code to make future testing easier. Code testability, they argued, was not their problem—it was the testers’ problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation came to a head during a sprint planning meeting, when the testers were giving some really large estimates for testing code that was going to take only a fraction of that amount of time to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programmers were asked if they could do anything to make the code easier to test. And it turned out there were some things they could do, but some of the programmers didn’t want to do them because they felt it would make their code less elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had defined their jobs as merely writing good code. Who cared if that code was hard to test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my plumber had done that, I would have had a fully functional sink, perhaps for years. But eventually enough debris would have made it past where a P-trap should have been installed and deep into my plumbing. This would have led to an expensive—and easily avoidable—repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When team members accept responsibility for issues caused downstream of their work, that team is truly prepared to succeed with agile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code review]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a code review page

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
