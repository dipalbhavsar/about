Code review is a process that enables peers and automated tools to check proposed changes to a codebase. The main goal of a code review is to catch potential issues, security problems, and bugs before they are introduced to the codebase and prevent them from causing problems in production.

Really, the code review can be fun. You try to hunt down well-disguised bugs before they hurt your production. You feel like a superhero defending your town every time you find a bug.

Most software developers are expected to participate in code reviews, and yet few are offered any training or guidance on conducting and participating in an effective code review. Participants attempt to find the most appropriate solution to a problem given the constraints of time, effort, and skills of all involved. But how do we have that conversation? What does an effective conversation look like? And what are the challenges of participating in a code review, and how can you overcome them?

Following useful literature could help to understand the purpose of code review and help to set up the process for conducting the effective code review with team members:
