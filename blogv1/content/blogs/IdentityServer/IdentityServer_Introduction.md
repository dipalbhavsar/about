<b>IdentityServer4 is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core.</b>

It enables the following features in your applications:

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Authentication as a Service</u></p>

Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services). IdentityServer is an officially <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">certified</a> implementation of OpenID Connect.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Single Sign-on / Sign-out</u></p>

Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Access Control for APIs</u></p>

Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Federation Gateway</u></p>

Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc. This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Focus on Customization</u></p>

The most important part - many aspects of IdentityServer can be customized to fit your needs. Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Mature Open Source</u></p>

IdentityServer uses the permissive Apache 2 license that allows building commercial products on top of it. It is also part of the .NET Foundation which provides governance and legal backing.
